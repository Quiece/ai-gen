If you have any questions, begin your message with something that rhymes with "Merry", just so I know you actually read the README.
#### How to:

# Set-up


# Use

# Modify
On the config file you can:
+ Change the model, loras and weights. What's in "general_furry" is always included so keep that in mind. Also mind that only 3 loras may be use at a time with the free plan.
+ Set the api key.
+ Set the save path.
+ Change the base prompt. This is added to the begining of all prompts.
+ Set worn clothes, if any.

Anything else, such as changing how many images are generated (by default 2 sets of 4), what they are about etc you'll need to go into the code. It shouldn't be too hard unless you want soomething complex.
